# ocbox

Rootless-Podman sandbox for running the [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) agent.

`ocbox` launches OpenCode's web UI inside a Podman container scoped to your
current project directory, with no root privileges required:

- **Filesystem**: only the project directory you run `ocbox` from is mounted
  into the sandbox (read-write). No other host path is visible from inside.
- **Network**: the container gets `--network=none` - no network device at
  all except loopback. The only thing it can reach is a local LLM server you
  configure; the only thing that can reach it is your browser, through a pair
  of relay processes ocbox starts on the host (see "How the isolation
  works" below).
- **Auth**: every run generates a fresh token, printed to your terminal, that
  gates access to the forwarded web UI.

## Requirements

- Linux
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation), running **rootless** (no
  `sudo`, no root daemon)
- A subuid/subgid range for your user (`ocbox` checks this and tells you how
  to fix it if missing)
- A locally-running LLM server your machine can reach (e.g. Ollama, vLLM,
  LM Studio, etc.)

### Installing Podman

**Ubuntu:**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman
```

**Rocky Linux:**

```sh
sudo dnf install -y podman
```

Podman is rootless by default on both once installed - just don't run it (or
`ocbox`) with `sudo`. If your user doesn't have a subuid/subgid range yet
(usually already set up by the package on Ubuntu, sometimes not on a fresh
Rocky install), set one and re-login:

```sh
sudo usermod --add-subuids 100000-165535 --add-subgids 100000-165535 "$USER"
# then log out and back in, or:
podman system migrate
```

Verify it's actually rootless before running `ocbox`:

```sh
podman info --format '{{.Host.Security.Rootless}}'   # should print "true"
```

`ocbox` never installs Podman or escalates privileges itself - if a
prerequisite is missing, it prints exactly what to run and exits.

## Setup

Install the package:

```sh
pip install -e .          # from a checkout, until this is published
```

Create `~/.config/ocbox/conf.py`:

```python
# ~/.config/ocbox/conf.py
LLM_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
LLM_PORT = 11434           # e.g. Ollama's default port

# Optional overrides (defaults shown):
# BASE_IMAGE = "ocbox/base:latest"
# CONTAINER_WEB_PORT = 4096
# HOST_WEB_PORT = None          # None picks a free ephemeral port
# EXTRA_APT_DEFAULT = []
# EXTRA_UV_DEFAULT = []
# MEMORY_LIMIT = None           # e.g. "2g"
# PIDS_LIMIT = None             # e.g. 512
```

A project can override any of these by adding its own `ocbox.conf.py` in the
project root.

## Usage

```sh
cd ~/projects/myapp
ocbox
```

You'll be asked whether to add any extra `apt` or `uv pip` packages to the
sandbox (blank to skip). ocbox then builds/reuses the sandbox image, starts
the container, and prints something like:

```
OpenCode is ready.
  URL:      http://127.0.0.1:53211
  Username: opencode
  Password: 8Kx3n...
  (keep this secret - do not share this terminal output)
```

Open the URL, sign in with the printed credentials, and OpenCode is running
against `myapp/`, isolated from the rest of your machine.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip the interactive package prompt, use config defaults |
| `--apt PKG...` / `--uv PKG...` | Set extra packages non-interactively |
| `--rebuild` | Force a rebuild of the project's sandbox image |
| `--web-port PORT` | Pin the host port for the web UI |
| `--agents-json PATH` / `--skills-dir PATH` | Use custom skills/agents instead of the packaged defaults |
| `--no-open` | Don't auto-open a browser |
| `--config PATH` | Use a conf.py other than `~/.config/ocbox/conf.py` |

## Default skills & agents

`src/ocbox/data/agents.json` and `src/ocbox/data/skills/` are templates you
can fill in once with the skills/agents you want available in every sandbox,
instead of reconfiguring OpenCode per project. Both are mounted read-only
into every container. Point `--agents-json`/`--skills-dir` at your own files
to override them per invocation.

## How the isolation works

Rootless Podman's default networking (slirp4netns) NATs out to the whole
internet - the opposite of "blocked by default." Instead, `ocbox` runs the
container with `--network=none` (a kernel-level guarantee: no network device
beyond loopback exists in the container's netns at all) and bridges exactly
two channels through Unix sockets bind-mounted from the host:

- **LLM egress**: a host-side relay listens on a Unix socket and dials your
  configured `LLM_HOST:LLM_PORT`; a matching relay inside the container turns
  that socket back into a local TCP port OpenCode talks to as if it were any
  ordinary HTTP endpoint.
- **Web UI ingress**: the same pattern in reverse - OpenCode's web server
  binds loopback inside the container, a relay exposes it on a Unix socket,
  and a host-side relay turns that into the TCP port your browser connects
  to.

No arbitrary destination is ever reachable from inside the sandbox, and no
container-internal port is ever published directly to the host.

## Known open questions

A few details of OpenCode's actual CLI/config surface (exact `opencode.json`
discovery path, whether `opencode web` auto-opens a browser, the real
skills/agents config schema, etc.) are ocbox's best-effort assumptions and
haven't been verified against OpenCode's live documentation. See the
docstrings in `sandbox.py` and `image.py`, and the project's plan file, for
what to double-check before relying on this in production.

## Development

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                                    # unit tests, no podman required
RUN_PODMAN_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/integration   # requires real podman
ruff check src tests
```
